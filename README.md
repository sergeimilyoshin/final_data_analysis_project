Hello, everybody!
This is my final project of the data analysis course that I took from Nov 2024 to Apr 2025.
I analized mobile gaming application:
a) wrote retention rate calculating and visualizing function
b) analized results of promotional kits A/B testing (2 t-tests and 1 z-test)
c) suggested metrics to analise promotional activities to upgrade users levels

Sorry, it is in Russian, as soon as I translate it I'll let you know.
