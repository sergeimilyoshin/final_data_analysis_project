Hello, everybody!<br>
This is my final project of the data analysis course that I took from Nov 2024 to Apr 2025.<br>
I analized mobile gaming application:<br>
a) wrote retention rate calculating and visualizing function<br>
b) analized results of promotional kits A/B testing (2 t-tests and 1 z-test)<br>
c) suggested metrics to analise promotional activities to upgrade users levels<br><br>

Sorry, it is in Russian, as soon as I translate it I'll let you know.
